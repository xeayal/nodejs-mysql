# Using Node.js and mysql | Creating a Simple API

Hello everyone, in this video, I will show you how to use Node.js and MySQL to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) by making GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to a database.

First, we will use npm, the popular package manager for Node.js, to install the necessary dependencies. Then, we will create a connection to the MySQL database. We will create a GET request to retrieve data from the database, a POST request to add new data, a PUT request to update existing data, and a DELETE request to delete data.

When retrieving data from the database with a GET request, we will use Express.js and other Node.js libraries to create an API, handle HTTP requests and MySQL queries, process the data, and return the results in JSON format. We will also cover security concerns and demonstrate how to handle errors related to the database.

If you want to develop an application using Node.js and MySQL, or if you just want to learn more about these technologies, this video is for you!
